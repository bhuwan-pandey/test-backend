## Installation

I assume you have Node.js along with NPM installed. Now install packages and run the app using:

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

By default, two users are created.
| Username| Password | Role |
| ------- | -------- | ---- |
| admin | admin | admin |
| User-A | user | user |
You can login view the visualization through admin login only
